/*
 * This program also shall take two arguments. The first argument indicates a number opf threads to create between 1 and 25. The second argument shall be a float indicating an amount of time in seconds between 0.1 and 10.0. This program can create up to 25 threads; however, this program shall create one thread each specificed time interval, until the requirested number of threads is created. Once all threads have been created, the program shall wait 5 seconds and then once per second kill each of the created threads until no more threads are running. At that point, the app2 program can exit.
 *
 * In this program, the threads can simply block - there is no requirement for the thread to do constant work. However, these threas should not terminate on their own.
